# Project_1_Growth
Our project is to uncover what growth the labour force experienced over last 30 years across Canada. We examined Industry sectors which have experienced the most/least growth. We undertook analysis to explore potential factors/characteristics that influenced this growth, including looking at the relationship between economic (GDP) and Academic factors (other factors were considered for future analysis – e.g. immigration trends, population growth, tax incentives etc.). The data will allow us to define areas of focus for opportunities in technology sector growth. 


## Question & Data
The specific questions we set out to answer were: 
Which NAICS sectors have experiences the largest growth within the Canadian labour force within the last 30 years? What are the top/bottom 5?
Of the top NAICS sectors, which is most related to ‘technology’? Does it exist within the top 5? 
If so, what are the micro trends as they relate to gender, geography and age? 
What might be an influence on the growth of this NAICS category?

## data analysis steps
1. Looked through the data to create a date frame that had relevant data to our question such as sex, labour force characteristics, age groups ,etc.
2. group the data in a 30 year and calculate the percentage change for each industry 
3. sort the data by ascending and descending to figure out the top 5 and bottom 5 industry in terms of percentage change
